"""Where an approved call was confirmed to act, re-checked by the tool before it acts.

Approval resolves the physical destination of a write, or the physical working
directory of a shell command, while the request is shown or matched. The tool
re-resolves it at its own boundary and refuses to act when it changed, so an
approval (or a remembered grant) never covers a different place.
